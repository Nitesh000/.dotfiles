### What the hell is this?
- This is just some of the configurations file I like to use. 
- Not all of these are entirely mine, I just copied most of then from like other developers.

### What's with this weird configurations?
- These are just like personal preferences. If you like you can also take or just copy it.

### Should I send some of my suggestions for this repo?
- Yeah feel free to do it. Or you can just add a pull request. 
- I will make sure to check it and then we can come to a conclusion.
